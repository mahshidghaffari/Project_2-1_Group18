# Welcome to the Project 2-1, presented by Group18 :
Ruben Matton, Chiara Paglioni, Ben Hasenson, Mahshid Ghaffari, Veselin Nasev, Alexis Mayet

RUN THE main CLASS OF THE FILE App.java to open our GUI,
from which you can choose the game style: 

    - Player vs. Player 
    - Player vs. AI
    - Baseline agent vs. AI

If no game style is selected Player vs. Player will take place. 
If the AI is involved, the depth of the tree should also be specified.
(For now the AI is able to play up to a depth of 3)
(For now it also not possible to choose the color thus, the AI will always be the black player)

Enjoy
