RUN THE main CLASS OF THE FILE App.java to open our GUI,
from which you can choose the game style: 

    - Player vs. Player 
    - Player vs. AI
    - Baseline agent vs. AI

Then, you can choose which color you would like to play in on the left.
After clicking play, a window will apear in which you can select the depth until which the
agent will search to. 

If no game style is selected Player vs. Player will take place. 
If the AI is involved, the depth of the tree should also be specified.
(For now the AI is able to play up to a depth of 5)

Enjoy
